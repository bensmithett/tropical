}

Images are [imported as modules](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url):

```jsx
import example from './example.jpg'
const Component = () => <img src={example} />
```

## Responsive images

You can generate derived images from your source image files, along with `srcset` and `<source>` data, using [named presets](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-image-presets) defined in [`src/imagePresets.js`](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/blob/HEAD/src/imagePresets.js).

Tropical provides [`<Image>`](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/tree/HEAD/src/components/tropical/Image) and [`<Picture>`](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/tree/HEAD/src/components/tropical/Picture) components for use with imported preset images.

```jsx
import example from './example.jpg?preset=thumbnail'

const Component = () => (
  <>
    <Image src={example} alt='My thumbnail' />

    <Picture src={example}>
      {(imgProps) => <img {...imgProps} alt='My thumbnail' />}
    </Picture>
  </>
)
```

For more examples see the stories for [`<Image>`](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/tree/HEAD/src/components/tropical/Image) and [`<Picture>`](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/tree/HEAD/src/components/tropical/Picture).

To understand when to use `<img>` and when to use `<picture>` see [MDN's Responsive Images docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

## Image references in MDX

Markdown-style image references won't [import the asset as a URL](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url).

```markdown
![this doesn't work](./photo.jpg)
```

You can either use [Vite's public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory):

```markdown
![This works!](/photo.jpg)

- assumes image is in public/photo.jpg
- image filename isn't hashed for production, so be careful with caching
```

or (because MDX lets you use JSX) you can just use a regular `import` and `<img>` like you would in a React component:

```
# Hello world

import photo from './photo.jpg'
<img src={photo} />
```

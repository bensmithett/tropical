Tropical vsâ€¦

## [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started)

Astro and Tropical have *very* similar aims and are built with the same approaches and [conventions](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/project-structure):

- First-class prerendered HTML
- Minimal client JS with [partial hydration](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration)/islands
- Components, pages, layouts, feedsâ€¦ ðŸ¥± told you Tropical's conventions were industry-standard!

Astro is great! Here are the main differences to be aware of:

### Astro is built on [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), Tropical is built on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Snowpack and Vite are both great, and worthy successors to Webpack. They're neck-and-neck in terms of features, support and popularity.

### Astro supports more component types on the server

Astro supports React, Vue and Svelte components out of the box, plus its own [Astro Component format](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/astro-components). Tropical assumes you'll use React for your prerendered/SSR components.

Both are flexible when it comes to client-side JS. Tropical [provides a way](/docs/browser-js/) to hydrate React components, while Astro [nudges you towards](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration) hydrating your React, Vue or Svelte components. 

Both options also let you âœ¨sprinkleâœ¨ on some progressive enhancement with Vue, vanilla JS, Stimulus, Angular, jQuery â€” whatever. In Tropical, `entry-client.jsx` is your oyster for enhancing React-generated HTML, while those special [Astro Components](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration#can-i-hydrate-astro-components) can have a `<script>` tag.

### CSS

Astro supports [many CSS approaches](https://docs.astro.build/guides/styling): plain old global CSS, scoped `<style>` tags in Astro Components, CSS Modules, Sass and Tailwind. 

Tropical comes with [Fela](https://fela.js.org/), though because Tropical is just Vite, you can also use [Vite's supported CSS approaches](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css).

There's one notable difference: **Tropical pages don't load a CSS file.** One of the benefits of Fela is that the generated atomic styles are tiny enough to just inline into a `<style>` in the page's `<head>`.

### Astro is a library, Tropical is a template repo

An Astro project depends on [`astro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro), a framework that abstracts away all the underlying functionality.

Tropical is intentionally a template repo, not a library. There's nothing to configure. The "framework" part of Tropical is just a couple of files â€” `entry-server.jsx`, `prerender.js` and `server.js` â€” right out there in the open, that you can tinker with and extend, or totally ignore.

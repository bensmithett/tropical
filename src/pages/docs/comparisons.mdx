## [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started)

Astro and Tropical have some very similar design principles and are built with a lot of the same approaches and [conventions](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/project-structure/):

- First-class prerendered HTML
- Minimal client JS via an [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) (though Astro is taking a *little* too much credit for pioneering the islands architecture — something [Tropical](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/blob/docs/app/decisions/003_dont_default_to_full_page_react_hydration.md) and [others](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) have been doing since 2019)
- Components, pages, layouts, feeds… 🥱 told you Tropical's conventions were industry-standard!

I'm a fan of Astro, it's a fine choice for your next project! Here are the differences:

### Astro is a framework, Tropical is a template repo

[`astro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro) is a framework that abstracts away all the underlying functionality. All of that underlying functionality, including Vite's, is configured at a distance via [Astro configuration](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/).

Tropical is intentionally a template repo, not a library or framework. It's just a Vite project. You directly configure Vite and edit the "framework" part of Tropical (really just some opinionated boilerplate for a Vite project).

### Astro is aiming big

Like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) before them, Astro is a [VC funded company](https://astro.build/blog/the-astro-technology-company/) with grand ambitions. They'll need to support a big, varied feature set to satisfy a big, varied audience.

Tropical isn't chasing a massive user base. I make it for me and hope a few of you find it useful!

### Different component approaches

Astro has [its own component format](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) which you can use to compose components from [lots of different component frameworks](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/).

Tropical just uses React components.

### Different techniques for island hydration and browser JS

Astro uses [*Client Directives*](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) to hydrate components. Arbitrary browser JS is [included with a `<script>`](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#client-side-scripts) in Astro components.

Tropical provides [tropical-islands](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) for basic React island hydration, and arbitrary browser JS is included and called however you like in your [client bundle](/docs/browser-js).

### CSS

Astro supports [many CSS approaches](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/): plain old global CSS, scoped `<style>` tags in Astro Components, CSS Modules, Sass and Tailwind. 

Tropical uses [Fela](https://fela.js.org/) by default. Notably, **pages don't load CSS files** — generated atomic styles are just inline in the page's `<head>`. (But because Tropical is just Vite, you can use any of [Vite's supported CSS approaches](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css).)

### Astro was originally built on [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)

Tropical originally used Webpack then switched to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Astro switched to Vite in 2022.

## [îles](https://iles.pages.dev/)

I'm also a big fan of îles. We share an island-themed name 🏝 and have [very similar goals](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/introduction):

> The goal of this project is to combine the ease of use and development experience of building a site with Vue, while effortlessly shipping a zero JS site as if you were using Jekyll or eleventy.

If you replace Vue with React, Tropical has basically the same motivation.

### îles uses Vue, Tropical uses React

...but we're both big fans of [MDX](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/markdown)!

### Different techniques for island hydration and browser JS

Like Astro, îles uses [hydration directives](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/hydration) and arbitrary browser JS is included via [`<script>` tags](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/client-scripts) in components.

Tropical provides [tropical-islands](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) for basic React island hydration, and arbitrary browser JS is included and called however you like in your [client bundle](/docs/browser-js).

### îles has some optimisations and features that Tropical intentionally avoids

Tropical will probably never come with [SPA navigation](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/turbo), [service workers](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/pwa) or [advanced routing features](https://iles.pages.dev/guide/routing#dynamic-routes) out of the box. But a Tropical site is just a Vite project, so you can add them if you wish!

## [vite-plugin-react-pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages)

vite-plugin-react-pages wraps up similar features (React, MDX, prerendering, dev server) in a [Vite plugin](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) that depends on some conventions around project folder structure and file naming.

It appears to be targeted mainly at the [docs](https://docusaurus.io/) use-case. It comes with a couple of themes ([docs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/master/packages/theme-doc) and [basic](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/master/packages/theme-basic)). In contrast to Tropical, it follows the Gatsby/Next model of full page hydration and client side page transitions.

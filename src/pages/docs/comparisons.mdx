## [vite-plugin-react-pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages)

vite-plugin-react-pages wraps up similar features (React, MDX, prerendering, dev server) in a [Vite plugin](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) that depends on some conventions around project folder structure and file naming.

It appears to be targeted mainly at the [docs](https://docusaurus.io/) use-case. It comes with a couple of themes ([docs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/master/packages/theme-doc) and [basic](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/tree/master/packages/theme-basic)). In contrast to Tropical, it follows the Gatsby/Next model of full page hydration and client side page transitions.

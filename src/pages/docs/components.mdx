Components are the building blocks that make up your pages and layouts. They're where you define HTML, CSS and (optionally) client-side JS behaviour. Build them quickly in Ladle, then compose them into pages and layouts.

Components live in `src/components`.

Create a new component with a sensible folder structure and Ladle stories from your terminal:

```bash
yarn component MyNewComponent
```

## Style with Fela

By default, Tropical uses [Fela](https://fela.js.org/) for styling components. You can opt for another of [Vite's CSS options](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) if you prefer.

See the [Fela docs](https://fela.js.org/) for more info, but essentially you just write CSS-in-JS that looks like inline styles, which Fela translates into optimised atomic classes:

```jsx
<div className={css({
  background: 'green',
  borderRadius: 5
})} />
<div className={css({
  background: 'green',
  borderRadius: 7
})} />

// <div class='a b'></div>
// <div class='a c'></div>
```

This results in tiny, atomic CSS that can be inlined in a server-rendered `<style>` in each page's `<head>`.

```html
<head>
  <style>.a{background:green}.b{border-radius:5}.b{border-radius:7}</style>
</head>
```

No CSS files, unused CSS, no client-side JS runtime required.

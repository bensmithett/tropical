export const meta = {
  title: `Layouts`
}

Layouts are React components that allow you to template the HTML _around_ your page content (a concept [borrowed from Rails](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Layouts.html)).

This could include things like:

- Tags for your `<head>`
- Shared header, footer or sidebar

You don't need to directly template your layout's `<head>` tags in place. Instead, use [react-head](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head) anywhere in the component hierarchy and Tropical will put everything in the right place in the final rendered HTML document.

## Default and alternative layouts

Pages use `src/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx` by default. You can safely edit the `DefaultLayout` provided by Tropical.

To specify a different layout for a page, provide a component to the page's `meta.Layout`:

```js
import DifferentLayout from '../layouts/different_layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Page with different layout',
  Layout: DifferentLayout
}
```

## Layout props

Layout components are rendered with 3 props:

- `pages` *(object)* — an object containing all of the site's pages, keyed by pathname
- `meta` *(object)* — the current page's `meta` object
- `children` *(React Element)* — the current page content

}

Tropical pages (and the React components you use to build them) are <u><b>only server-rendered</b></u> by default.

For example, this component would render a button in your page's prerendered HTML, but the click handler won't automatically work.

```jsx
const HiButton = ({ name }) => (
  <button onClick={() => alert(`hi ${name}`)}>
    Hi
  </button>
)
```

By default, the component isn't included in the browser JS bundle (`src/entry-client.jsx`), nor is the server-rendered HTML [hydrated](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate).

You can hydrate or [progressively enhance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) server-rendered HTML in Tropical however you wish, even **without using React in the browser!** 

In `src/entry-client.jsx` you can manually add event listeners with vanilla JS, or use a library like [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) or [viewloader](https://github.com/icelab/viewloader) for a more structured approach.

Of course, there are advantages to using React in the browser, regardless of whether you're hydrating server-rendered HTML or doing something purely client-side.

## Islands and partial hydration

Tropical encourages an [Islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) for taking full advantage of React. In React terms, it means we only want to hydrate specific parts of the page (aka [partial hydration](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/partial-hydration-concepts-lazy-and-active/)) rather than hydrating a single root "page" component and everything it contains.

You can do this with the included [tropical-islands](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) package.

Use `<Island>` in your server-rendered pages and components:

```jsx
import { Island } from 'tropical-islands'

export const MyPage = () => (
  <>
    <StaticThing />
    <Island componentName='HiButton'>
      <HiButton name='Debbie' />
    </Island>
    <AnotherStaticThing />
  </>
)
```

Then use `hydrateComponents` in the browser JS bundle `src/entry-client.jsx`:

```javascript
import { hydrateIslands } from 'tropical-islands'
import { HiButton } from './components/HiButton'

hydrateIslands({
  HiButton
})
```

See the [tropical-islands docs](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) for more detailed usage instructions for `<Island>` and `hydrateIslands`.

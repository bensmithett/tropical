## Features üçπ

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for prerendered HTML & *opt-in* [browser JS](/docs/browser-js) via [island hydration](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) or your own progressive enhancements
- [Fela](http://fela.js.org/) for *fast* atomic component styles without CSS files
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and everything that comes with it, including a fast [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)-powered <abbr title='Hot Module Replacement'>HMR</abbr> dev server, and a tree-shaken [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) production build
- [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) component [stories](https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf)
- [Responsive images](/docs/images) and [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) transformations
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Markdown ([GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighting
- [Pages](/docs/pages), [layouts](/docs/layouts), [tags](/docs/pages#page-meta), **collections** & **dates** ‚Äî all the conventions and metadata you need to build a real site or blog
- [JSON Feeds](https://jsonfeed.org/)

**Tropical is just a [template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**. You're not stuck with these features. If [Vite can do it](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html), so can your Tropical site!

## Non-features üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Tropical starts from the idea that old-fashioned HTML with minimal browser JS is üöÄ **blazing fast‚Ñ¢**, so it doesn't *force* you to adopt any of these:

- [client-side route transitions](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1186515553285857280)
- [lazy loading](https://www.bensmithett.com/an-argument-against-lazy-loading/)
- code splitting
- Progressive Web App‚Ñ¢ and service workers
- [full page hydration](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/blob/docs/app/decisions/003_dont_default_to_full_page_react_hydration.md)
- TypeScript
- GraphQL

If you do want those things, go nuts! Tropical is based on Vite's [React preset](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) so all [Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) are available. It's also very light on abstractions, so you can easily make it your own without fighting the framework.

## No painful API churn ü§ï

Once you mint a new site from the template repo, it's your project to make your own.

You won't ever "update" Tropical to a new version. Instead, [releases](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/releases) provide guides for updating dependencies and conventions at your own pace, without any Big Bang version upgrades that make you rewrite everything just to get that one new feature.

## Who built this?

Hi there! I'm [Ben](https://www.bensmithett.com/), I've been building websites and industrial-strength static site tooling for a while now. I've used the internet in enough far-flung places to have some pragmatic opinions about which web performance strategies really matter.

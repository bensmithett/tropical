## Features 🍹

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for Markdown with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighting
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Fela](http://fela.js.org/) for atomic, *fast* component-based CSS
- [Vite's](https://vitejs.dev/) outrageously fast [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)-powered dev server (with **Hot Module Replacement** and **Live Reload**) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) build
- **First class prerendering (SSR)**
  - Prerendered HTML pages by default
  - *Optionally* sprinkle on browser JS, or adopt the [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) using [tropical-islands](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) for [partial React hydration](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/partial-hydration-concepts-lazy-and-active/)
- All the conventions you need to build a real site or blog: **pages**, **layouts**, and **metadata** like tags and dates
- A [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/)

**Tropical is just a [template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**. There's no library to install or configure. You're not stuck with these features. If [Vite can do it](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html), so can your Tropical site.

## Non-features 🙅‍♀️

Good old-fashioned HTML is 🚀 **blazing fast™**. Tropical lets you build static HTML pages, with minimal browser JS, using all the powerful, flexible and modern JS tooling you love.

Because it's built on Vite (using Vite's [React preset](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) and following Vite's guides) [all Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) are available. Of course you can add any libraries and as much browser JS as you wish, but Tropical doesn't *force* you to adopt:

- [client-side route transitions](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1186515553285857280)
- [lazy loading](https://www.bensmithett.com/an-argument-against-lazy-loading/)
- code splitting
- Progressive Web App™ and service workers
- [full page hydration](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/blob/docs/app/decisions/003_dont_default_to_full_page_react_hydration.md)
- TypeScript
- GraphQL

## Who built this?

Hi there! I'm [Ben](https://www.bensmithett.com/), I've been building websites for a while now. I've worked on industrial-strength static site tooling at [Envato](https://envato.com/) & have experienced enough 💩🐌 internet connections around the world to have opinions about web performance strategies.

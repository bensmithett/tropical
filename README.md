Welcome to your new [Tropical](https://tropical.js.org/) site!

Using your choice of `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`, install dependencies then (using `yarn` as an example)...

- **`yarn dev`** starts a dev server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- **`yarn build`** builds the static site into `dist/static`
- **`yarn stories`** starts [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/)
- **`yarn page my-new-page`** scaffolds a file for a new page
- **`yarn component MyNewComponent`** scaffolds files for a new component

Check out [the docs](https://tropical.js.org) or dive in and explore the `src` directory.

Welcome to your new [Tropical](https://tropical.js.org/) site!

Install dependencies with `yarn`, then...

- **`yarn dev`** starts a dev server at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)
- **`yarn build`** builds the static site into `dist/static`
- **`yarn storybook`** starts [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- **`yarn page my-new-page`** scaffolds a file for a new page
- **`yarn component MyNewComponent`** scaffolds files for a new component

(`npm` equivalients to `yarn` commands should work too)

Check out [the docs](https://tropical.js.org) or dive in and explore the `src` directory.

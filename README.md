Install dependencies with `yarn`, then...

- **`yarn dev`** starts a dev server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- **`yarn build`** builds the static site into `dist/static`
- **`yarn storybook`** starts [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- **`yarn page my-new-page`** scaffolds a file for a new page
- **`yarn component MyNewComponent`** scaffolds files for a new component

(`npm` equivalients to `yarn` commands should work too)
